Abstract

INSTRUCTIONS:

Let us create 3 nodes token ring topology.
For three node Topo, in node0.c file , change the value '#define N 3' in line 16.

now copy the same node0.c file to node1.c node2.c

Open node0.c file, and change the value of 'int num=0;' in line 29.
Similarly, set the value of num variable in node1.c file to 1
set the value of num variable in node2.c file to 2

Now in different terminal windows, launch each node as follows :
gcc node0.c -o node0            << compile
./node0                         << run

Do the above compile and run steps for node1.c and node2.c as well.
Your three node topology shall be launched.
